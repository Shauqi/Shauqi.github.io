            <p>I am a PhD candidate at Stony Brook University, working with Prof. Chao Chen and Prof. Joel Saltz. My research centers on probabilistic models and spatial statistics for medical imaging, with a focus on developing trustworthy AI, interpretable learning frameworks, and advanced tools for spatial agent modeling. I am currently pursuing two key research directions. The first involves leveraging contrastive Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to create probabilistic models that can disentangle meaningful factors in the latent space, with a particular focus on applications to gigapixel pathology images. The second direction is the development of a spatial analysis toolkit, complete with a dashboard-based web interface, designed to process large-scale 2D point clouds derived from pathology images. This toolkit aims to assist pathologists and clinicians in validating hypotheses related to spatial statistics.</p>
